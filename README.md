## Project Overview
Battery health monitoring is crucial for ensuring the safety and efficiency of battery-powered systems. This project utilizes hybrid AI models to accurately predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) and State of Charge (SOC) of batteries, which are essential parameters for effective battery management.

## Dataset
The project uses the NASA Battery RUL dataset containing operational data for various battery cycles, including voltage, current, temperature, and capacity measurements.

## Objectives
- Predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of batteries to optimize maintenance schedules.
- Estimate the State of Charge (SOC) for real-time battery management.
- Develop hybrid AI models that combine data-driven and physics-based approaches for accurate predictions.

## Approach
1. **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values, noise, and outliers for cleaner data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Extracting relevant features to enhance model performance.
3. **Model Development:** Building hybrid AI models for both RUL and SOC prediction.
4. **Model Evaluation:** Comparing performance metrics for each model.
5. **Insights and Recommendations:** Providing actionable insights for battery health management.

## Modeling Techniques
The project explores the following hybrid AI models:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for feature extraction.
- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for sequence prediction.
- Ensemble Learning techniques for enhanced accuracy.
